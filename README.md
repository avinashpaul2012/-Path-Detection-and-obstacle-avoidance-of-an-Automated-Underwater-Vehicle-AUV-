# Path Detection and obstacle avoidance of an Automated Underwater Vehicle (AUV)

I got the opportunity to work in a defence project funded by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), India. I learned about the dynamics and modelling of AUV motion. My contribution involved simulating the AUV motion and designing a PID controller meant for path detection. After simulation, I successfully tested my algorithm for avoiding obstacles under water and detecting the path of the AUV.

First the model of the AUV is linearized and then the tranfer function is found to design the controller.
